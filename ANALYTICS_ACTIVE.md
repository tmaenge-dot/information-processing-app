## 🔍 NEXT CRITICAL STEP: Google Search Console

Your app now tracks visitors BUT is still **NOT indexed by Google Search**.

### Submit to Search Console (10 minutes):

#### 1. Go to Search Console
Visit: **https://search.google.com/search-console**

#### 2. Add Your Property
- Click "Add Property"
- Select "URL prefix"
- Enter: `https://tmaenge-dot.github.io/information-processing-app/`
- Click "Continue"

#### 3. Verify Ownership (HTML Tag Method)
You'll get a meta tag that looks like:
```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR-VERIFICATION-CODE" />
```

**Add this tag to your `index.html`:**
- Open: `/home/oem/Desktop/Information Processing App/index.html`
- Find line 16 (after `<meta name="revisit-after" content="7 days" />`)
- Add the verification meta tag there
- Save the file

#### 4. Rebuild and Deploy
```bash
cd "/home/oem/Desktop/Information Processing App"
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Add Google Search Console verification"
git push origin main
```

#### 5. Complete Verification
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
- Go back to Search Console
- Click "Verify"
- Should see: ✅ "Ownership verified"

#### 6. Submit Your Sitemap
- In Search Console, go to "Sitemaps" (left menu)
- Enter: `sitemap.xml`
- Click "Submit"

#### 7. Request Indexing
- Go to "URL Inspection"
- Enter: `https://tmaenge-dot.github.io/information-processing-app/`
- Click "Request Indexing"
